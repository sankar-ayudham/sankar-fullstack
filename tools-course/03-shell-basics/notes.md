## Safety Awareness

### Why rm -rf is dangerous
rm -rf deletes files and directories recursively without confirmation.
A wrong path can permanently delete critical system or project files.

### Why unnecessary sudo should be avoided
sudo runs commands as root. Using it without understanding can break
permissions, damage the system, or create security risks.
