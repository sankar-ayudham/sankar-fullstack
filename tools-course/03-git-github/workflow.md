## My Daily Git Workflow

1. Check repository status using git status
2. Make small, focused changes
3. Stage changes with git add
4. Commit with a clear message
5. Push changes to the remote repository

## Git history and diffs

- git log shows the chronological history of commits.
- git diff helps review changes before committing.
- git show displays the details of a specific commit.
